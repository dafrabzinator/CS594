I've learned a lot about the software development process yet again.  

In the process of making this program, blah blah


did you know wireshark's default when saving a capture is its own native format?

I got the error:

Gigabot:bonus stacy$ python start.py -f wikipedia_page.pcap 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "start.py", line 95, in <module>
    reader = dpkt.pcap.Reader(f)
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dpkt/pcap.py", line 104, in __init__
    raise ValueError, 'invalid tcpdump header'
ValueError: invalid tcpdump header


... turns out wireshark actually outputs its own version by default.
if you do a save-as, you can choose a tcpdump pcap option which gives the format the program was expecting.
